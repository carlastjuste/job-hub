# Job-Hub

## The Purpose

When searching for jobs as a professional; it can be incredibly overwhelming, due to the fact that you have to create multiple accounts on mulitple site, to receive results. As individuals branching out to a new career space, we have found a way to circumvent this obstical. JobHub is a web application that allows the users to search for job vacancies and keep track of the jobs that they are interested in and have applied for. The goal is to create one place where the user can find jobs that are posted on Linkedin, Indeed, Zip Recruiter and so on without the discomfort that comes with managing different accounts on multiple job-oriented
platforms.


## Concept

Job Hub is an open sourced, job search tool. The app uses API's to search multiple sites for information, pertaining to the users selected career or specified search. The app is a single point resource for anyone that does not want to subscribe to multiple sites. This app brings the user the utility of multiple sites, but makes that data available in one consolidated application. All the user has to do is make an account, add their certifications, and search through the list of jobs the app provides.
